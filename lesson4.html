            <h2>Lesson: The Tower of Babel</h2>
            <p>After the flood, people began to repopulate the earth. They all spoke the same language and decided to build a city with a tall tower that reached the heavens. They wanted to make a name for themselves and avoid being scattered across the earth. However, this plan went against God’s desire for humanity to fill the earth and trust in Him. To stop their plans, God confused their language so they could no longer understand one another. This caused them to scatter across the earth, forming different nations and languages.</p>
