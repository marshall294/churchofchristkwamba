            <h2>Lesson: The Tower of Babel</h2>
            <p>After the flood, people began to repopulate the earth. They all spoke the same language and decided to build a city with a tall tower that reached the heavens. They wanted to make a name for themselves and avoid being scattered across the earth. However, this plan went against God’s desire for humanity to fill the earth and trust in Him. To stop their plans, God confused their language so they could no longer understand one another. This caused them to scatter across the earth, forming different nations and languages.</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>The Unity:</b> After the flood, everyone spoke the same language and worked together.
        <ul>
            <li>Genesis 11:1 - "Now the whole world had one language and a common speech."</li>
            <li>Explanation: Following the flood, all humanity shared one language and were united in their communication, which allowed them to work together effectively.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>The Tower:</b> People decided to build a tall tower to make a name for themselves and avoid scattering.
        <ul>
            <li>Genesis 11:4 - "Then they said, 'Come, let us build ourselves a city, with a tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for ourselves; otherwise we will be scattered over the face of the whole earth.'</li>
            <li>Explanation: The people sought to make a name for themselves by building a great tower. Their goal was to centralize their power and avoid being scattered, reflecting human pride and a desire for self-glory.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>God’s Intervention:</b> God confused their language to stop their plans.
        <ul>
            <li>Genesis 11:7 - "Come, let us go down and confuse their language so they will not understand each other."</li>
            <li>Explanation: God intervened to prevent the people's prideful ambition. By confusing their language, He made it impossible for them to communicate, halting their construction of the tower.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>The Scattering:</b> The people spread out across the earth, forming different nations.
        <ul>
            <li>Genesis 11:8 - "So the Lord scattered them from there over all the earth, and they stopped building the city."</li>
            <li>Explanation: God's intervention resulted in the scattering of people across the globe, fulfilling His command to fill the earth (Genesis 9:1) and leading to the formation of different nations and cultures.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>God’s Plan:</b> God desires unity through His purpose, not human pride.
        <ul>
            <li>Acts 17:26-27 - "From one man he made all the nations, that they should inhabit the whole earth; and he marked out their appointed times in history and the boundaries of their lands. God did this so that they would seek him and perhaps reach out for him and find him, though he is not far from any one of us."</li>
            <li>Explanation: God’s ultimate plan is for humanity to be united in His purpose—seeking Him, not in self-glorification. He desires people from all nations to come together in worship and fellowship with Him.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
