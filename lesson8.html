    <h2>Lesson: The Ten Plagues</h2>
    <p>When Pharaoh refused to let the Israelites go, God showed His mighty power through ten terrible plagues. Each plague proved that God is more powerful than any king, god, or force on earth. Even though Pharaoh's heart was hard, God remained faithful to His people and prepared the way for their freedom. This story reminds us that nothing is greater than God, and He will always fight for His children.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>The Warning:</b> Moses tells Pharaoh to let the people go.
        <p><i>Exodus 7:16</i>: "Let my people go, so that they may worship me in the wilderness."</p>
      </li>

      <li><b>The First Plague:</b> Water turns to blood.
        <p><i>Exodus 7:20</i>: Moses strikes the Nile, and it becomes blood.</p>
      </li>

      <li><b>More Plagues:</b> Frogs, gnats, flies, livestock disease, boils, hail, locusts, darkness, and death of the firstborn.
        <p><i>Exodus 8–12</i>: God sends plague after plague, but Pharaoh refuses to listen until the final plague.</p>
      </li>

      <li><b>God’s Victory:</b> Pharaoh finally lets the Israelites go.
        <p><i>Exodus 12:31</i>: "Up! Leave my people, you and the Israelites! Go, worship the Lord as you have requested."</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
