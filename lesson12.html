            <h2>Lesson: Deborah the Judge</h2>
            <p>In Judges 4–5, we learn about Deborah, a prophetess and the only female judge of Israel. Deborah demonstrated courage, wisdom, and leadership as she led Israel during a time of oppression. When God called her to lead, she trusted His guidance and called Barak to join her in battle against the Canaanite army. The victory was a testament to God’s faithfulness, and Deborah’s song of praise in Judges 5 celebrates God’s power and deliverance.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Deborah’s Leadership:</b> Deborah was a prophetess who judged Israel during a time of great difficulty. She was a woman of courage and wisdom, sought by the people for guidance. God used her to deliver Israel from oppression. She shows that God can use anyone, regardless of gender, to fulfill His purposes. <br>
                    <i>Judges 4:4-5</i> — “Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, was leading Israel at that time.”<br>
                    <i>Proverbs 31:25</i> — “She is clothed with strength and dignity; she can laugh at the days to come.”
                </li>

                <li><b>God’s Call to Action:</b> Deborah called upon Barak, the military leader, to gather an army and fight the Canaanites. She was clear about God’s instructions, showing boldness in calling Barak to action. Despite initial hesitation from Barak, Deborah’s trust in God remained firm, and she assured him of victory. <br>
                    <i>Judges 4:6-7</i> — “The Lord, the God of Israel, commands you: ‘Go, take with you ten thousand men of Naphtali and Zebulun and lead them up to Mount Tabor.’”<br>
                    <i>Psalm 20:7</i> — “Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we trust in the name of the Lord our God.”
                </li>

                <li><b>Victory Through Obedience:</b> With Deborah’s leadership and God’s power, Israel won the battle. The victory was not because of human strength, but because of God’s intervention. Deborah’s obedience to God’s command and Barak’s willingness to act led to the defeat of the Canaanites and the salvation of Israel. <br>
                    <i>Judges 4:15</i> — “The Lord routed Sisera and all his chariots and army by the sword…”<br>
                    <i>2 Corinthians 12:9</i> — “But he said to me, ‘My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.’”
                </li>

                <li><b>Deborah’s Song of Praise:</b> After the victory, Deborah and Barak sang a song of praise to God for His deliverance. This song celebrated God’s justice, power, and the courage of the leaders who answered His call. It reminds us that we should always give glory to God for His guidance and victories. <br>
                    <i>Judges 5:1-3</i> — “On that day Deborah and Barak son of Abinoam sang this song: When the princes in Israel take the lead, when the people willingly offer themselves—praise the Lord!”<br>
                    <i>Psalm 34:1</i> — “I will bless the Lord at all times; his praise will always be on my lips.”
                </li>

                <li><b>God Uses Ordinary People:</b> Deborah was a woman in a male-dominated society, but God used her to lead Israel. Her story shows that God’s calling does not depend on societal norms or expectations. He can use anyone, regardless of gender, age, or background, to fulfill His divine purpose. <br>
                    <i>1 Corinthians 1:27</i> — “But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong.”<br>
                    <i>Acts 9:36</i> — “In Joppa there was a disciple named Tabitha… who was always doing good and helping the poor.” (God uses both men and women in His work.)
                </li>
            </ul>
