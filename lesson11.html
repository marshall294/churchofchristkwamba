            <h2>Lesson: Joshua and the Battle of Jericho</h2>
            <p>In Joshua 6, God commands Joshua to lead the Israelites around the fortified city of Jericho for six days. Each day, they march around the city once. On the seventh day, they march seven times, blow their trumpets, and shout. By God's miraculous power, the walls of Jericho collapse, giving Israel victory. This teaches us that through faith and obedience, we can achieve great victories in God’s plan.</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>God’s Command:</b> God gave Joshua a clear and unconventional battle plan to take the fortified city of Jericho. Instead of using weapons or force, God instructed them to march around the city once a day for six days, and seven times on the seventh day, followed by a trumpet blast and a shout. This plan emphasized that victory would come by God’s power, not human strength. <br>
    <i>Joshua 6:2–5</i> — God says, “I have delivered Jericho into your hands.”<br>
    <i>Isaiah 55:8–9</i> — “For my thoughts are not your thoughts…” reminds us that God’s plans often defy human logic.
  </li>

  <li><b>Israel’s Obedience:</b> Despite the unusual instructions, the Israelites followed God’s command exactly. They marched around the city without questioning or murmuring, showing discipline and trust. Their obedience was a demonstration of faith in action. <br>
    <i>Joshua 6:6–14</i><br>
    <i>Deuteronomy 28:1</i> — “If you fully obey the Lord your God… the Lord your God will set you high above all the nations.”<br>
    <i>James 2:17</i> — “Faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead.”
  </li>

  <li><b>Victory by Faith:</b> On the seventh day, after marching seven times around the city and giving a great shout, the walls of Jericho collapsed — just as God had promised. Their faith and obedience were rewarded with a miraculous victory. <br>
    <i>Joshua 6:15–20</i><br>
    <i>Hebrews 11:30</i> — “By faith the walls of Jericho fell, after the people had marched around them for seven days.”<br>
    <i>2 Corinthians 10:4</i> — “The weapons we fight with… have divine power to demolish strongholds.”
  </li>

  <li><b>Rahab’s Rescue:</b> Rahab, a Canaanite woman and former prostitute, was spared because she protected the Israelite spies and believed in the power of the God of Israel. Her faith led to salvation—not just physically, but spiritually, as she is later listed in the genealogy of Jesus. <br>
    <i>Joshua 6:22–25</i><br>
    <i>Hebrews 11:31</i> — “By faith the prostitute Rahab… was not killed with those who were disobedient.”<br>
    <i>Matthew 1:5</i> — Rahab is listed in the lineage of Christ.
  </li>

  <li><b>God’s Power Revealed:</b> The conquest of Jericho demonstrated God’s sovereign power over nations, walls, and human plans. It reminded Israel (and us today) that victory belongs to the Lord and that He fights for His people when they trust and obey Him. <br>
    <i>Joshua 6:27</i> — “So the Lord was with Joshua, and his fame spread throughout the land.”<br>
    <i>Psalm 20:7</i> — “Some trust in chariots… but we trust in the name of the Lord our God.”<br>
    <i>Romans 8:31</i> — “If God is for us, who can be against us?”
  </li>
</ul>
