            <h2>Lesson: Joshua and the Battle of Jericho</h2>
            <p>In Joshua 6, God commands Joshua to lead the Israelites around the fortified city of Jericho for six days. Each day, they march around the city once. On the seventh day, they march seven times, blow their trumpets, and shout. By God's miraculous power, the walls of Jericho collapse, giving Israel victory. This teaches us that through faith and obedience, we can achieve great victories in God’s plan.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><b>God’s Command:</b> God instructed Joshua with a very specific plan to take Jericho. <br><i>Joshua 6:2-5</i></li>
                <li><b>Israel’s Obedience:</b> The Israelites obeyed every command faithfully without questioning. <br><i>Joshua 6:6-14</i></li>
                <li><b>Victory by Faith:</b> On the seventh day, after their obedience and faith, the walls fell. <br><i>Joshua 6:15-20</i></li>
                <li><b>Rahab’s Rescue:</b> Rahab and her family were saved because of her faith. <br><i>Joshua 6:22-25</i></li>
                <li><b>God’s Power Revealed:</b> God showed His power in delivering Jericho into their hands. <br><i>Joshua 6:27</i></li>
            </ul>
