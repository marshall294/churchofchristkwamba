    <h2>Lesson: Moses and the Burning Bush</h2>
    <p>Moses was tending sheep in the desert when he saw a bush that was on fire but didn’t burn up. As he approached, God called to him from the bush and gave him a special mission: to rescue the Israelites from slavery in Egypt. Moses felt afraid and unsure, but God promised to be with him. This story shows us that God has a purpose for each of us and that He will equip us for what He calls us to do.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>The Encounter:</b> God appears to Moses through a burning bush.
        <p><i>Exodus 3:2-3</i>: "There the angel of the Lord appeared to him in flames of fire from within a bush. Moses saw that though the bush was on fire it did not burn up. So Moses thought, 'I will go over and see this strange sight—why the bush does not burn up.'"</p>
      </li>

      <li><b>The Call:</b> God calls Moses to deliver His people from Egypt.
        <p><i>Exodus 3:10</i>: "So now, go. I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring my people the Israelites out of Egypt."</p>
      </li>

      <li><b>The Doubt:</b> Moses feels unworthy and afraid to accept God’s call.
        <p><i>Exodus 3:11</i>: "But Moses said to God, 'Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?'"</p>
      </li>

      <li><b>The Assurance:</b> God promises His presence and power.
        <p><i>Exodus 3:12</i>: "And God said, 'I will be with you. And this will be the sign to you that it is I who have sent you: When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you will worship God on this mountain.'"</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
