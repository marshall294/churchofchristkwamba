        <h2>Lesson: Moses and the Burning Bush</h2>
        <p>Moses was tending sheep in the desert when he saw a bush on fire that was not burning up. God called to him from the bush and gave him a special mission: to lead the Israelites out of slavery in Egypt. Moses felt unsure and afraid, but God promised to be with him. This story teaches us that God calls each of us for a special purpose, and He gives us the strength we need to fulfill it.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>The Calling:</b> God appears to Moses in a burning bush.
                <p><i>Exodus 3:2-4</i>: "There the angel of the Lord appeared to him in flames of fire from within a bush. Moses saw that though the bush was on fire it did not burn up. So Moses thought, 'I will go over and see this strange sight—why the bush does not burn up.' When the Lord saw that he had gone over to look, God called to him from within the bush, 'Moses! Moses!' And Moses said, 'Here I am.'</p>
            </li>

            <li><b>The Mission:</b> God calls Moses to lead His people out of Egypt.
                <p><i>Exodus 3:10</i>: "So now, go. I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring my people the Israelites out of Egypt."</p>
            </li>

            <li><b>Moses' Doubts:</b> Moses feels afraid and unsure.
                <p><i>Exodus 3:11-12</i>: "But Moses said to God, 'Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?' And God said, 'I will be with you.'"</p>
            </li>

            <li><b>God’s Assurance:</b> God promises to be with Moses and gives him signs.
                <p><i>Exodus 4:1-5</i>: God gives Moses signs like the staff turning into a snake to show His power.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
