            <h2>Lesson: God Calls Moses</h2>
            <p>While Moses was tending sheep in the wilderness, he saw an incredible sight: a bush that was on fire but not burning up. God spoke to Moses from the bush and told him to take off his sandals because he was standing on holy ground. God called Moses to lead His people out of slavery in Egypt. Even though Moses felt unworthy and afraid, God promised to be with him. This story reminds us that God calls us to fulfill His purpose, and He will equip us for the task.</p>
