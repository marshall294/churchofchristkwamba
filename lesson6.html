        <h2>Lesson: Joseph’s Dreams</h2>
        <p>Joseph was one of Jacob’s 12 sons and was greatly loved by his father. This caused his brothers to become jealous. Joseph had two dreams where he saw his family bowing down to him, which made his brothers even more upset. Out of jealousy, they sold him into slavery in Egypt. Despite this, Joseph trusted God, and over time, God elevated him to a position of power. Joseph’s story reminds us to trust in God’s plan and timing, even in difficult circumstances.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><b>The Dreams:</b> Joseph dreamed that his brothers and family would bow down to him. 
                <p><i>Genesis 37:5-7</i>: "Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers, they hated him all the more. He said to them, 'Listen to this dream I had: We were binding sheaves of grain out in the field when suddenly my sheaf rose and stood upright, while your sheaves gathered around mine and bowed down to it.'"</p>
            </li>
            
            <li><b>The Jealousy:</b> Joseph’s brothers became jealous of him and sold him into slavery.
                <p><i>Genesis 37:11</i>: "His brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the matter in mind." 
                <br><i>Genesis 37:28</i>: "So when the Midianite merchants came by, his brothers pulled Joseph up out of the cistern and sold him for twenty shekels of silver to the Ishmaelites, who took him to Egypt."</p>
            </li>

            <li><b>The Trials:</b> Joseph faced challenges as a slave and prisoner in Egypt.
                <p><i>Genesis 39:2-4</i>: "The Lord was with Joseph so that he prospered, and he lived in the house of his Egyptian master. When his master saw that the Lord was with him and that the Lord gave him success in everything he did, Joseph found favor in his eyes and became his attendant." 
                <br><i>Genesis 39:20-21</i>: "Joseph’s master took him and put him in prison, the place where the king’s prisoners were confined. But while Joseph was there in the prison, the Lord was with him; he showed him kindness and granted him favor in the eyes of the prison warden."</p>
            </li>

            <li><b>The Redemption:</b> God raised Joseph to a position of power in Egypt, where he saved many lives during a famine.
                <p><i>Genesis 41:14-16</i>: "So Pharaoh sent for Joseph, and he was quickly brought from the dungeon. When he had shaved and changed his clothes, he came before Pharaoh. Pharaoh said to Joseph, 'I had a dream, and no one can interpret it. But I have heard it said of you that when you hear a dream you can interpret it.' 'I cannot do it,' Joseph replied to Pharaoh, 'but God will give Pharaoh the answer he desires.'"</p>
            </li>

            <li><b>The Reunion:</b> Joseph forgave his brothers and trusted in God’s timing.
                <p><i>Genesis 45:4-5</i>: "Then Joseph said to his brothers, 'Come close to me.' When they had done so, he said, 'I am your brother Joseph, the one you sold into Egypt! And now, do not be distressed and do not be angry with yourselves for selling me here, because it was to save lives that God sent me ahead of you.'" 
                <br><i>Genesis 50:20</i>: "You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives."</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
