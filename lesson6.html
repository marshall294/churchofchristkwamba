            <h2>Lesson: Joseph’s Dreams</h2>
            <p>Joseph was one of Jacob’s 12 sons and was greatly loved by his father. This caused his brothers to become jealous. Joseph had two dreams where he saw his family bowing down to him, which made his brothers even more upset. Out of jealousy, they sold him into slavery in Egypt. Despite this, Joseph trusted God, and over time, God elevated him to a position of power. Joseph’s story reminds us to trust in God’s plan and timing, even in difficult circumstances.</p>
