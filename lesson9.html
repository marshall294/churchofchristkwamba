    <h2>Lesson: Crossing the Red Sea</h2>
    <p>After escaping Egypt, the Israelites found themselves trapped between the Red Sea and Pharaoh's army. They were afraid, but Moses told them to trust God. God performed a miracle by parting the waters, making a dry path through the sea. The Israelites crossed safely, and the pursuing Egyptians were swept away. This amazing story reminds us that God leads us, protects us, and makes a way even when things seem impossible!</p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>The Israelites Escape Egypt:</b>
        <p><i>Exodus 14:5-9</i>: Pharaoh changes his mind and chases after the Israelites.</p>
      </li>

      <li><b>The People Are Afraid:</b>
        <p><i>Exodus 14:10-12</i>: The Israelites cry out to Moses when they see the Egyptians coming.</p>
      </li>

      <li><b>God Makes a Way:</b>
        <p><i>Exodus 14:21-22</i>: Moses stretches out his hand, and God parts the Red Sea.</p>
      </li>

      <li><b>Victory!</b>
        <p><i>Exodus 14:29-31</i>: The Israelites safely walk through the sea, and they see God's great power.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
