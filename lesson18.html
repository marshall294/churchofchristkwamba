      <h2>Lesson: David Becomes King</h2>
      <p>
        In 2 Samuel 5, David finally becomes king over all Israel. Though God had promised him the throne years earlier when he was anointed by Samuel, David had to wait through many trials before the promise was fulfilled. His story reminds us that God’s timing is always perfect, and waiting on Him prepares us for His greater purposes.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>God’s Promise:</b> David was anointed as a boy but had to wait many years before becoming king.<br>
          <i>1 Samuel 16:13</i> — “So Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him… and the Spirit of the Lord came powerfully upon David.”</li>

        <li><b>God’s Preparation:</b> During the waiting years, David learned patience, leadership, and reliance on God.<br>
          <i>Psalm 27:14</i> — “Wait for the Lord; be strong and take heart and wait for the Lord.”</li>

        <li><b>God’s Perfect Timing:</b> When the time was right, David was crowned king at age 30 and reigned for 40 years.<br>
          <i>2 Samuel 5:4</i> — “David was thirty years old when he became king, and he reigned forty years.”</li>

        <li><b>Application for Us:</b> God may ask us to wait for His promises. Delays are not denials—they are preparation.<br>
          <i>Ecclesiastes 3:11</i> — “He has made everything beautiful in its time.”</li>
      </ul>
