            <h2>Lesson: God’s Promise to Noah</h2>
            <p>In the time of Noah, the world was full of wickedness. God saw that Noah was a righteous man, so He decided to save Noah and his family from a great flood that would cover the earth. God gave Noah specific instructions to build an ark. Noah obeyed God, and when the flood came, Noah, his family, and the animals were safe in the ark. After the flood, God made a promise to Noah that He would never again destroy the earth with a flood, and He placed a rainbow in the sky as a sign of this promise.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>God’s Call:</b> God saw that Noah was righteous, so He told Noah to build an ark to save his family and animals.</li>
                <li><b>The Ark:</b> Noah obeyed God and built a massive ark, as instructed by God.</li>
                <li><b>The Flood:</b> Noah, his family, and the animals entered the ark, and the floodwaters came.</li>
                <li><b>God’s Promise:</b> After the flood, God made a covenant with Noah, promising never to destroy the earth with a flood again.</li>
                <li><b>The Rainbow:</b> God placed a rainbow in the sky as a sign of His promise to Noah.</li>
