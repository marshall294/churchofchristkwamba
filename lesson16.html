      <h2>Lesson: Samuel and the Call of God</h2>
      <p>In <b>1 Samuel 3</b>, we learn how God called Samuel as a young boy while he was serving in the temple under Eli the priest. Samuel did not recognize God’s voice at first, but with Eli’s guidance, he learned to listen and respond: “Speak, Lord, for your servant is listening.” This story teaches us the importance of listening for God’s voice, obeying Him, and being ready to serve when He calls.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>God Calls Samuel:</b> One night, while Samuel was lying down in the temple, God called him by name. At first, Samuel thought it was Eli calling, but Eli told him it was the Lord. <br>
          <i>1 Samuel 3:4</i> — “Then the Lord called Samuel. Samuel answered, ‘Here I am.’”<br>
          <i>John 10:27</i> — “My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me.”
        </li>

        <li><b>Learning to Listen:</b> Samuel did not recognize God’s voice at first, but Eli instructed him to say, “Speak, Lord, for your servant is listening.” This shows the importance of guidance and learning how to hear from God. <br>
          <i>1 Samuel 3:9</i> — “Speak, Lord, for your servant is listening.”<br>
          <i>James 1:19</i> — “Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry.”
        </li>

        <li><b>Obedience to God:</b> Once Samuel recognized God’s call, he listened carefully and obeyed. He became a faithful prophet who delivered God’s message to Israel. <br>
          <i>1 Samuel 3:19</i> — “The Lord was with Samuel as he grew up, and he let none of Samuel’s words fall to the ground.”<br>
          <i>Luke 11:28</i> — “Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and obey it.”
        </li>

        <li><b>God Uses the Young:</b> Samuel was just a boy when God called him. This shows us that God can speak to and use children for His work. <br>
          <i>Jeremiah 1:7</i> — “Do not say, ‘I am too young.’ You must go to everyone I send you to and say whatever I command you.”<br>
          <i>Matthew 19:14</i> — “Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.”
        </li>
