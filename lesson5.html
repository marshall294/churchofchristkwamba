            <h2>Lesson: Abraham’s Faith in God’s Covenant</h2>
            <p>God called Abraham to leave his home and travel to a land He would show him. God promised Abraham that He would make him the father of many nations and bless all the families of the earth through him. Even though Abraham and his wife Sarah were old and had no children, Abraham trusted God. God made a covenant with Abraham, giving him the sign of circumcision and promising him countless descendants. Abraham’s faith in God’s promises inspires us to trust in God’s plans, even when they seem impossible.</p>
