            <h2>Lesson: Abraham’s Promise (Genesis 12–17)</h2>
            <p>God made a covenant with Abraham, promising to bless him and make his descendants a great nation. Despite challenges, Abraham trusted God's promises, showing great faith. Through Abraham, God began the plan of salvation for the world. In Genesis 12-17, we see God's call to Abraham, the covenant of circumcision, and the promise of a child in Abraham's old age, which all demonstrate God's faithfulness to His word.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>God's Call:</b> God called Abraham to leave his country and promised to make him the father of a great nation.  
                    <ul>
                        <li>Genesis 12:1-2 - "The Lord had said to Abram, 'Go from your country, your people and your father’s household to the land I will show you. I will make you into a great nation, and I will bless you; I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing.'" </li>
                        <li>Explanation: Abraham was called to trust in God's promises and step out in faith, leaving everything familiar behind.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>The Promise of Descendants:</b> God promises Abraham numerous descendants, even though he is old and childless.  
                    <ul>
                        <li>Genesis 15:5 - "He took him outside and said, 'Look up at the sky and count the stars—if indeed you can count them.' Then he said to him, 'So shall your offspring be.'" </li>
                        <li>Explanation: God reassured Abraham that his descendants would be countless, symbolized by the stars in the sky.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>Covenant of Circumcision:</b> God establishes a covenant with Abraham and requires circumcision as a sign of this covenant.  
                    <ul>
                        <li>Genesis 17:10-11 - "This is my covenant with you and your descendants after you, the covenant you are to keep: Every male among you shall be circumcised. You are to undergo circumcision, and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and you." </li>
                        <li>Explanation: Circumcision is a physical symbol of Abraham’s faith and obedience to God's covenant.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>The Promise of Isaac:</b> Despite being 100 years old, God promises Abraham that he will have a son named Isaac.  
                    <ul>
                        <li>Genesis 17:19 - "Then God said, 'Yes, but your wife Sarah will bear you a son, and you will call him Isaac. I will establish my covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his descendants after him.'" </li>
                        <li>Explanation: God fulfills His promise by giving Abraham and Sarah a son, Isaac, through whom God's covenant will continue.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
