      <h2>Lesson: David and Goliath</h2>
      <p>In <b>1 Samuel 17</b>, we read about David, a young shepherd boy, who faced the giant Goliath with nothing but a sling, five stones, and faith in God. While the Israelite army trembled in fear, David trusted God’s strength and declared that the battle belonged to the Lord. With one stone, David defeated Goliath, showing us that with God on our side, we can overcome the “giants” in our lives — no matter how big they seem.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Faith in God, Not in Size:</b> David was smaller and weaker than Goliath, but he trusted God’s power, not weapons or armor. <br>
          <i>1 Samuel 17:45</i> — “David said to the Philistine, ‘You come against me with sword and spear, but I come against you in the name of the Lord Almighty…’”<br>
          <i>Zechariah 4:6</i> — “‘Not by might nor by power, but by my Spirit,’ says the Lord Almighty.”
        </li>

        <li><b>Courage Over Fear:</b> While the Israelite soldiers were afraid, David showed courage because he knew God was with him. <br>
          <i>1 Samuel 17:32</i> — “David said to Saul, ‘Let no one lose heart on account of this Philistine; your servant will go and fight him.’”<br>
          <i>Joshua 1:9</i> — “Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid… for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go.”
        </li>

        <li><b>God Uses the Ordinary:</b> David defeated Goliath with just a sling and a stone, proving that God can use simple things and ordinary people for extraordinary victories. <br>
          <i>1 Samuel 17:50</i> — “So David triumphed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone.”<br>
          <i>1 Corinthians 1:27</i> — “God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong.”
        </li>

        <li><b>The Battle Belongs to the Lord:</b> David reminded everyone that the victory was God’s, not man’s. <br>
          <i>1 Samuel 17:47</i> — “…for the battle is the Lord’s, and he will give all of you into our hands.”<br>
          <i>Romans 8:31</i> — “If God is for us, who can be against us?”
        </li>
      </ul>
